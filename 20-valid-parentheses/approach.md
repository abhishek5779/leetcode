# Approach to Solve "Valid Parentheses"

To solve the "Valid Parentheses" problem, a person should approach it systematically as follows:

## 1. Understand the Problem
The task is to determine if a string containing only the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['`, and `']'` is valid.  
A string is valid if:
- Every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket of the same type.
- Brackets are closed in the correct order.

## 2. Plan the Solution
- Use a **stack** data structure to keep track of open brackets.
- Iterate through the string:
  - Push opening brackets (`'('`, `'{'`, `'['`) onto the stack.
  - For closing brackets (`')'`, `'}'`, `']'`):
    - Check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket.
    - If it matches, pop the stack.
    - If it doesn't match or the stack is empty, the string is invalid.
- After processing the string, if the stack is empty, the string is valid. Otherwise, it is invalid.

## 3. Optimize
- The solution has a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string, as each character is processed once.
- The space complexity is **O(n)** in the worst case, where all characters are opening brackets.

By following this structured approach, the problem can be solved efficiently and correctly.
