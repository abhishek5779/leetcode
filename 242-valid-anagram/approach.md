# Approach to Solve "Valid Anagram"

To solve the "Valid Anagram" problem, a person should approach it systematically as follows:

## 1. Understand the Problem
You are given two strings, `s` and `t`.  
The task is to determine if `t` is an anagram of `s`.  
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another, using all the original letters exactly once.

## 2. Plan the Solution
**Key Insight**: Two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters with the same frequencies.  
**Approach**:
- Check if the lengths of `s` and `t` are different. If they are, return `false` immediately.
- Use a frequency counter (e.g., a dictionary or array) to count the occurrences of each character in `s` and `t`.
- Compare the frequency counts of both strings. If they match, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

## 3. Optimize
- **Time Complexity**: The solution has a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the strings, as each character is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(1)** if we assume the character set is fixed (e.g., lowercase English letters).
