# Approach to Solve "Valid Palindrome"

## Understand the Problem:
A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward after:
- Converting all uppercase letters to lowercase.
- Removing all non-alphanumeric characters.

Return `true` if the string is a palindrome, otherwise return `false`.

## Plan the Solution:
- Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to traverse the string from both ends.
- Skip non-alphanumeric characters using `isalnum()` function.
- Compare characters at the `left` and `right` pointers:
  - If they are not equal, return `false`.
  - If they are equal, move the pointers inward.
- If the pointers cross each other, return `true`.

## Complexity Analysis:
### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string. Each character is processed at most once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**, as no additional data structures are used.
